# Why
In order to get new clients and also clients outside of the esports worlds, I’ve decided to create a website to showcase my photography portfolio. The homepage allows the potential customer to see my favourite photos rotating in a big header which is animated using Javascript. 

# Site description
Underneath the header, I added a short but powerful introduction about who I am. It is important for clients to know who they are dealing with and see my face to build a personal connection and gain their trust.

Below that in a jumbotron, I added all the services I can provide as a freelancer since I do not only take photos. The last row before the footer with all my contact information are the big clients I previously worked with. These clients will be known to people inside of the esports industry.

On another page I included a longer bio for people who are interested in my back side story. I decided to create a separate page so I could write a longer biography to ensure people I have the right expertise for their job. The reason I didn’t include it on the homepage is because the paragraphs are too long and it is not vital information that should go on the front page.

For the actual photography portfolio itself I was thinking about the diversity of my photoshoots. I shoot a lot of different genres; nature, travel, portrait, lifestyle, esports and street. I wanted clients to be able to filter my photos by category to immediately see my skills for each specific job. An esports client likely is not interested in nature or travel photography. Someone looking to book a portrait photoshoot is not interested in street photography.

And finally, I added a button in the navigation bar that leads directly to my Instagram page on a new blank page so my website stays open in another tab.

# Objective
The main objective for the website is to land photography gigs outside my job, show off my portfolio to family & friends and maybe gain some followers on Instagram which could help land jobs in the future.

# Future implementations

I received a lot of valuable feedback during the presentations from both our lecturer as well as my classmates. Before uploading the website to the host server and replacing my older website done with Wix, I want to implement some of the feedback. I’ve made a to-do list for to finalize the website:
- Use more icons, these can be implemented in the footer, such as all the links to social media. Icons could also be used in the services section on top of the images.
- Instead of just providing an email, create a ‘Get in contact’ button with the use of HTML and animate it using javascript.
- Space the sections a bit more to give certain parts more breathing space. This can be done easily by adding more padding.
- Use some more brand colors to put extra emphasis on the titles and important parts.
